# WhoStudied_ALC
WhoStudied? is a quiz app I created for my Andela/Google Nanodegree scholarship.
The MainActivity collects your name, your team (Boys House or Girls house) and the topic(s) you are intrested in getting quized on.
The idea is a Boys vs Girls Quiz App where Player's test score gets added (updated) to the total score of their house i.e Boys house or Girls house (though i havent fully implemented the part where the total house score gets updated).
