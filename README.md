# WhoStudied_ALC

# Introduction
WhoStudied? is a quiz app I created for the first phase of my Google/Udacity/Andela Android Basic Nanodegree scholarship (Africa). It's the first Android application I built.

# Idea
The idea is a Boys vs Girls Quiz like the one we had back in pry/sec school. Here, Player's quiz score gets added (updated) to the total score of their team (Boys team or Girls team) creating a new total score (though i havent fully implemented the part where the total house score gets updated).

# Functionality
The MainActivity gets your name, your team (Boys House or Girls house) and the topic(s) you are intrested in getting quized on.
It then uses these data to personalize your experience in the Test Activity; which is where you will take your test and get your score. There are only two questions per topic; to get a feel of the different types of questions, kinldy check the checkbox for the 3 topics (Nigeria, Founders and Startups), they will produce 2 questions each; a total of 6 questions.

# Finally 
I'm proud of myself as i have changed as a better person, since i started reading codes. Thank you Google, Udacity and ALC.
