# WhoStudied_ALC
WhoStudied? is a quiz app I created for my Andela/Google Nanodegree scholarship.

The MainActivity gets your name, your team (Boys House or Girls house) and the topic(s) you are intrested in getting quized on.
It then uses these data to personalize your experience in the Test Activity; which is where you will take your test and get your score.

The idea is a Boys vs Girls Quiz App where Player's quiz score gets added (updated) to the total score of their house i.e Boys house or Girls house (though i havent fully implemented the part where the total house score gets updated).

This is a link to the .apk file for Whostudied. Please scroll down as its located right at the bottom of the folder. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-YksbZdzrb8vvIwsiwvR9KU1wda1HqQC

I'm proud of myself as i have changed since i started reading codes. Thank you ALC.
